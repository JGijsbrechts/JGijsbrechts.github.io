I am an Assistant Professor at [Esade Business School](https://www.esade.edu/en), Ramon Llull University. My research centers around the question: "How to go from data to decision in this era of Big Data?"

I have a strong affinity for the recent developments in Prescriptive Analytics. Working with and within the consumer goods industry has inspired me to close the gaps to transition towards wide industry adoption of these methods in Operations and Supply Chain Management. In my research I am currently combining Machine Learning and (Robust) Optimization to develop data-driven algorithms.

You can download my [CV](assets/pdf/CV_Joren.pdf) for more details.
